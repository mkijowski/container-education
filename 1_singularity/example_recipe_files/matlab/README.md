The ```R*.build``` buildfiles create a container with a full version of matlab.  These containers require the matlab installation media to be in the current directory in order to be built properly.  These containers will also only work when on a campus network (VPN included).  http://www.wright.edu/information-technology/security/virtual-private-networks-software-overview

The ```MCR*.build``` buildfile creates a container with the MCR which is available for free but requires the Matlab Compiler Toolbox and a full version of Matlab installed on a linux system elsewhere for the user to compile their programs for.
