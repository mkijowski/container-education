# Matlab

The ```R*.build``` buildfiles create a container with a full version of matlab.  These containers 
require the matlab installation media to be in the current directory in order to be built 
properly (obtained from Mike Vanhorn).  These containers will also only work when on a campus 
network (VPN included).

The ```MCR*.build``` buildfile creates a container with the MCR which is available for free but 
requires the Matlab Compiler Toolbox and a full version of Matlab installed on a linux system 
elsewhere for the user to compile their programs for.

If anyone needs a newer version of Matlab feel free to contact @mkijowski
